# Linux-kernel-programming
I assume that you are comfortable programming in C and are familiar with Operating System concepts in general. Experience in Embedded Software / Firmware helps but is not mandatory.

This course draws heavily from the following sources:
1) [Linux Kernel Device Drivers, 3rd edition by Corbet, Rubini and Hartman](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Drivers-Jonathan-Corbet/dp/0596005903/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=Linux+Kernel+Device+Drivers&qid=1621231877&sr=8-3)
2) [Linux Kernel Programming (Part 1) by Kaiwan Billimoria](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Kernel-Development-Cookbook-programming-ebook/dp/B07RW915K4/ref=pd_sbs_1?pd_rd_w=gaobh&pf_rd_p=98101395-b70f-4a52-af63-8fac2c513e02&pf_rd_r=NFWK130JF47B6V8MFR00&pd_rd_r=3cf68a79-23d0-4e72-a3de-ebc749a5e7b8&pd_rd_wg=JxeMo&pd_rd_i=B07RW915K4&psc=1)
